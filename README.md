The name's **Kai**. I'm embracing the **mediocre** life not S-tier, not trash, just chillin' in the mid-lane. I keep things neutral and natural; not here for the drama or the hype. 

I'm a permanent **Live-Long Learner** because every mistake is just a new tutorial. I can nap anywhere. So yeah, I'm just here for the vibes, trying to grow, and definitely not stressed.
