The name's **Kai**, and my whole existence is giving **Platypus energy**, no cap. I'm here doing a lot, but I'm just gonna be real, none of it is really *hitting different* (yet). 

I'm embracing the **mediocre** life—not S-tier, not trash, just chillin' in the **mid**-lane. I keep things **neutral** and **natural**; not here for the drama or the hype. 

My biggest flex? I'm a permanent **Live-Long Learner** because every mistake is just a new tutorial, you feel me? And when I’m not coding, my main passion is **snoozing** 😴. Seriously, if Snoopy can nap on his doghouse, I can nap anywhere. So yeah, I'm just here for the vibes, trying to grow, and definitely not stressed.
